// Go programs are organized into packages.
// A package is a collection of source files in the same directory that are compiled together.
// Functions, types, variables, and constants defined in one source file are visible to all other source files within the same package.
// A module is a collection of related Go packages that are released together.

// Variadic parameters in package functions:
// Example:
// func Println(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
// ... means variadic parameter
// the type interface{} means as many arguments of any type you'd like
